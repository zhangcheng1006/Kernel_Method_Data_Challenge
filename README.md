## How to run the scripts:
- Data files are not included in the submission. To run the code, please put them (raw data files with sequences, embedded matrix files) in a folder ```/data/``` under the home directory of the project
- The **start.py** script includes all methods except the context-tree model, running ```python3 start.py``` will reproduce the submission .csv file
- The Context-Tree model is implemented in the module **context_tree_model.py**, running ```python3 context_tree_model.py``` will reproduce the submission file generated by Context-Tree model
